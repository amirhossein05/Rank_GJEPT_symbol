# Rank_GJEPT - Symbol Rank Calculation for Noisy Channels
This repository contains a C++ project that calculates symbol rank using a Gaussian Jordan Elimination algorithm, which is particularly useful for noisy communication channels. The symbol rank calculated by this project can be applied to channel codes such as Reed-Solomon codes to enhance error correction performance.
## Features
\item Rank Calculation: The project computes the rank of symbols, which is a critical metric in error correction and detection in communication systems.
Support for Noisy Channels: The rank calculation is optimized for channels with noise, improving the accuracy and efficiency of error detection in practical use cases.
Channel Coding Support: The symbol rank calculations work well with error-correcting codes, including Reed-Solomon codes, to protect data integrity.
CSV Integration: The project includes CSV file support for input/output of matrix data (matrix.csv, e2p.csv, p2e.csv), simplifying data handling and integration.
